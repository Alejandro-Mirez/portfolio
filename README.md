# About me
Relatively new in IT world but a very keen learner. Targeting: software testing, QA, security testing. Side-eyeing: front-end web development. I like doing smart stuff and getting to understand things I never thought I would understand. Graduated in 2020 with a Master's Degree in law, worked as a probation officer for a while but that just wasn't for me. Tried out testing and coding and it seems to be the right path for my introverted nature.
